# Demonstration dataset for SVP

 + `pdac_a_spe`: 
 This is a `SpatialExperiement` object, which contains the gene counts of spatial transcriptome of a PDAC (sample A) from the [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0392-8).

 + `pdac_a_sce`: 
 This is a `SingleCellExperiment` object, which contains the gene counts of single-cell transcriptome of a PDAC (sample A) from the same [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0392-8).

# Usage

Note: In the `R` environment

```r
# load spatial transcriptome
pdac_a_sce <- readRDS(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiangpin/Data_for_Vignette_SVP/main/data/pdac_a_sce.rds"))

# load single-cell transcriptome
pdac_a_spe <- readRDS(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiangpin/Data_for_Vignette_SVP/main/data/pdac_a_spe.rds"))
```
